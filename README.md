Using this you can write an .img file to multiple usbs at the same time. Has a web user interface built with preact and vite

## Usage

Updates need to be started through the web interface.

To get everything running on ubuntu run `make install`

The ui's title (Jedatehdas) is a reference to the finnish upper secondary school I made this for.
